AI-driven code generation tools such as GitHub Copilot reduce development time by:

Automating boilerplate code (loops, API calls, test stubs).

Improving productivity through context-aware suggestions.

Reducing cognitive load, letting developers focus on problem-solving.

Limitations:

Generated code may contain bugs, inefficiencies, or security risks.

Relies heavily on training data, which may introduce bias.

Developers risk over-reliance, losing debugging skills.

Legal issues around copyrighted suggestions.
