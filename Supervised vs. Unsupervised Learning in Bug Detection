Supervised Learning: Uses labeled bug datasets (e.g., “buggy” vs. “clean”). Works well when sufficient labeled data is available. Example: Classifying GitHub issues.

Unsupervised Learning: Works on unlabeled data, clustering, or detecting anomalies in commit logs. Useful for zero-day bugs.

Comparison: Supervised → high accuracy with labels. Unsupervised → effective in discovering unknown or rare bug patterns.
