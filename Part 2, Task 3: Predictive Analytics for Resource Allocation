You trained both Logistic Regression and Random Forest on the Heart Disease Dataset.

Logistic Regression Accuracy: 84%

Random Forest Accuracy: 88%

F1-Score (LR): 0.84

Key Insights

Random Forest performed better overall due to its ability to handle nonlinear patterns.

Feature importance analysis showed age, cholesterol, and thalassemia type were key predictors.

The model was exported (heart_rf_model.pkl) and successfully used to predict outcomes for new user data.

Example Prediction: For a test CSV of 5 users, the model predicted heart disease for only one case (ID 2).
